# Sanitizer_Dispenser
The Contact-less hand sanitizer dispenser is an infrared motion sensor-based dispenser. It is used to dispense any alcohol-based sanitizer. It has a touch-less operation, which makes it convenient for people to use it fearlessly and confidently. It facilitates the sanitization process. You may call it as an automatic or touch-free sanitizer dispenser. When hands are placed in the proximity of the sensor, the infrared sensor detects the object (hand). This is then used as an input for the Arduino Uno. If the object is within the range of IR sensor then the pump gets activated and dispenses the designated amount of sanitizer.
